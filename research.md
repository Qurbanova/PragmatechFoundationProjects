### What i _transistor_ and how it works?
  A transistor is a 3 terminal electronic device made of semiconductor material. It has many uses like  amplification, switching, voltage regulation, and the modulation of signals. There are 2 types of BJT:
  
   - pnp
      - *Base is connected to the higher potential to allow current flow.*
      -  It means high potential at collector and low potential at emitter.
       
   - npn
        - *Base is connected to the lower potential that allows current flow*
       -  It means high potential at emitter and low potential at collector.
       
  It has 3 elements:**emitter collecter and base.**
  1. ***Emitter***: emits the electrons which pass through device.
   2. ***Collector***: collect them while thes pass through the device.
   3. ***Base***: The middle section which forms two pn junctions between the emitter and collector. The base-emitter junction is forward biased, allowing low resistance for the emitter circuit. The base-collector junction is reverse biased and provides high resistance in the collector circuit.
