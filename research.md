### What i _transistor_ and how it works?
  A transistor is a 3 terminal electronic device made of semiconductor material. It has many uses like  amplification, switching, voltage regulation, and the modulation of signals. There are 2 types of BJT:
  
   - pnp
      - *Base is connected to the higher potential to allow current flow.*
      -  It means high potential at collector and low potential at emitter.
       
   - npn
        - *Base is connected to the lower potential that allows current flow*
       -  It means high potential at emitter and low potential at collector.
       
  It has 3 elements:**emitter collecter and base.**
  1. ***Emitter***: emits the electrons which pass through device.
   2. ***Collector***: collect them while thes pass through the device.
   3. ***Base***: The middle section which forms two pn junctions between the emitter and collector. The base-emitter junction is forward biased, allowing low resistance for the emitter circuit. The base-collector junction is reverse biased and provides high resistance in the collector circuit.
  
### How to convert between 10-digit number system and 2-digit number system?
  - In binary numbers we use just 2 digits: 0 and 1.(2 lik say sistemi)
  - In decimal numbers we use 10 digits; from 0 to .(10 luq say sistemi)
 
  ### *When i want to convert decimal number to binary number*
  1. We should devide it 2 till the result will be 1.
  2. Then we use remainders, arrange them from the bottom the the top.
 
 For example:
 > 35
 > 
 > 35:2=17 r(1)
 > 
 > 17:2=8 R(1)
 > 
 > 8:2=4 R(0)
 > 
 > 4:2=2 R(0)
 > 
 > 2:2=1 R(0)

Then we should rearrange remainders from the left to the right starting from the last one. 

> 00011
> So, **35**(decimal)=**00011**(binary)

  ## When i want to convert binary number to decimal number 
  1. We should write the degree of the digits from the left to the right
  2. Then we multiply o and 1 with their degrees and find the sum of them.
    For example;
    
    >1010010
    
    >1*2('6)+0*2('5)+1*2('4)+0*2('3)+0*2('2)+1*2('1)+0*2('0)=64+0+16+0+0+2+0=82
    
    > IT MEANS that **1010010**(binary)= **82** (decimal)
